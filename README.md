# Epion Front End Interview Project

_Epion devs: please see [README-epion.md](README-epion.md)_

Thanks for being interested in coming to work here at Epion Health. Our team values building, reviewing, and pairing on well-crafted applications.  This repo was built to test how you build applications and how you would fit in working with the team at Epion.  It's a simplified version of an assessment form in our Check-in application, and will give you some insight into our product development process.  If you'd like to learn more about our Check-in product please visit our [website](https://epionhealth.com/patient-engagement-software/patient-check-in-software/)

## Let's get started

### Setup

Please go ahead and clone this repo. Before you start, you should have:

* Node 12+
* Yarn 1.22.x

## Installing dependencies

In the project directory, run:

`yarn`

## Running the project

In the project directory, run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Running the tests

Now you can run the tests and watch them fail!

`yarn test`

## The coding exercise

- [ ] Add enough code to make the test pass
- [ ] Keep track of the state of the form
- [ ] Validate the form when the user submits
- [ ] Change the checkboxes to appear as "tags"
- [ ] Please open a pull request, and email your interviewer that it's ready

When you have implemented the validation, the form should have a message at the top. If there are any questions for which you have not provided answers, you should see this:

> ![validation failed](screenshots/validation-failed.png)

If you check off at least one option for each question, you should see this:

> ![thank you](screenshots/thank-you.png)

When you have converted the checkboxes to tags, they should look like this:

> ![tags-selected](screenshots/tags-selected.png)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
